This plugin logs the position of any block that a player breaks that looks a bit like a tree. Every 30 minutes each entry in this list of positions is checked more thoroughly to make sure it is a tree and that is it not connected to the ground. When it is found that there are leaves with no logs connecting them to the ground, all of the logs of that tree will be removed allowing the leaves to decay naturally.
